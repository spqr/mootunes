Hong Zhang and Shane Clark carried out the experiment described in the README
file. We were able to confirm that the demodulator is working reliably by
looking at all 4 channels simultaneously. "High" regions were reliably decoded,
as evidenced by regular spacing between peaks. Distinctions between 1's and
0's were also obvious based on the width of the "high" regions.
